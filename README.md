# `playback_loop.sh`
This is the main Bash script of this repo and it serves to play songs in
some directory (e.g. `data/dance`) in an infinite loop with a given order
specified in the variable `DANCE_TYPE_CYCLE` in the script. The whole
serves to play songs for dancers in a ballroom with as least repetitiveness
as possible.


## Usage
Once the repo downloaded, one can just run the script by

```bash
$ ./playback_loop.sh
```

To play one's own songs, specify your own dance song directory by the option `-d`

```bash
$ ./playback_loop.sh -d path/to/your/own/dance/dir/
```

and eventually fill that directory with more and more songs to dance!ðŸ’ƒðŸ•º

For more options on the usage, please also check out the help message:

```bash
$ ./playback_loop.sh -h
```


## TODO
- [x] Rename the variables named by Gemini
- [ ] Take note of what you learned into another repo (called `bash-man` maybe)
- Make the execution of the script more user-friendly on Fedora for elderly
    - [x] Auto-execution of the script upon logging
- Teach Mom
    - [ ] Bluetooth connection btw laptop and speaker
    - [ ] How to next song
    - [ ] How to pause the music
    - [ ] How to turn off the music altogether
    - [ ] How to restart the laptop
- Verbessern `playback_loop.sh`
    - Bugs
        - [x] Deal with the edge case where, say, `dance/rumba` contains no song file at all.
    - Features
        - [x] Logging: Datetime, logging to a file, logging level, etc.
        - Ask LLMs or google to improve `playback_loop.sh`
            - [x] External command invocation less efficient than Basn parameter expansion?
            - [x] Re-initialization of `RANDOM_INDEX_STR`'s last index may bump into the 1st index from last time. [Think of a stack.] Avoid this.
            - [x] Use nameref instead of (`dance_type: str -> song_paths: str`) dictionary
            - [ ] Replace all `while read` by `readarray`/`mapfile`?
        - Write tests for `playback_loop.sh`
        - [x] Add command-line options to `playback_loop.sh`?
